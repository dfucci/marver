Marver
======

Marver is (going to be an) easy to use Ruby gem for [Marvel's API](http://developer.marvel.com/). It is still in development and any contribution is welcomed.


### TO DO:

##### Write core classes
* Serie
* Event
* Creator
* More?  


##### Entity Finder classes
Should be implemented within the Marver::Client class.

* CharacterFinder (in progress)
* SerieFinder
* StoryFinder
* ComicFinder
* EventFinder
* More?


Refactor generation of resource lists for core classes, maybe add a builder module?
