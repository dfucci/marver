Marver
======

Marver is (going to be an) easy to use Ruby gem for [Marvel's API](http://developer.marvel.com/).
It is **still VERY MUCH in development** and it doesn't really do much right now. Also, any kind of contribution is **welcomed**. 


### TO DO:

##### Entity Finder classes
Should be implemented within the Marver::Client class.

* CharacterFinder (in progress)
* SerieFinder
* StoryFinder
* ComicFinder
* EventFinder
* More?


##### Entity Builders
Maybe too much metaprogramming...
